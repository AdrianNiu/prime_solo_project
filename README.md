Users can add notes to a specific saved sentiment chart and tweet they saved.

## Prerequisites

To use the Twitter API, you can establish a twitter developer account following [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access). 

Before you get started, you can check if the following softwares have been installed on your computer:


## Installation

3. Create a `.env` file at the root of the project and paste this line into the file:
    ```
    SERVER_SESSION_SECRET=superDuperSecret

    * While you're in your new `.env` file, take the time to replace `superDuperSecret` with some long random string like `25POUbVtx6RKVNWszd9ERB9Bb6` to keep your application secure. Here's a site that can help you: [https://passwordsgenerator.net/](https://passwordsgenerator.net/). If you don't do this step, create a secret with less than eight characters, or leave it as `superDuperSecret`, you will get a warning.
